#TITLE

Comparing Gross Domestic Product to Education Data

Contributors: Georges Michel, Jack Nelson, Nicole Shaver, Nathan Tuttle

#PURPOSE OF PROJECT

This project takes two different datasets, one containing Gross Domestic Product by 
country and the other containing education statistics by country, and compares the two
based on country.  A series of questions are answered with last output comparing Gross
Domestic Product rankings to the income group of that country. 

#COPYRIGHT INFO

This project was generated for Southern Methodist University course MSDS 6306

*Datasets sources*

GDP.csv: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FGDP.csv

EDDATA.csv: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FEDSTATS_Country.csv

#FILE ORGANIZATION

____ <- signifies a folder (i.e. data <- = data folder)

"|" separates multiple files in the same folder (i.e. GDP.csv | EDDATA.csv) 

The original file structure is as follows:

  + ReadME.md

  + Makefile.txt

  + data <-

  + paper <- GDPandEducation_CaseStudy1.Rmd

  + source <- download.R | tidy_ED_GDP.R | merge_ED_GDP.R

*After running the Makefile in the command line...*

The file structure should be as follows:

  + ReadME.md
  
  + Makefile.txt
  
  + data <- GDP.csv | EDDATA.csv
  
  + paper <- GDPandEducation_CaseStudy1.Rmd | GDPandEducation_CaseStudy1.html
  
  + source <- download.R | tidy_ED_GDP.R | merge_ED_GDP.R

#HOW TO REPRODUCE RESEARCH

To reproduce the study download the project to the desired file path.  Open up the 
command line on your machine.  Navigate to the file path the project was downloaded to
in the command line.  Type 'make all' in the command line.  The remaining files along 
with the GDPandEducation_CaseStudy1.html should be populated in the project's folder.
